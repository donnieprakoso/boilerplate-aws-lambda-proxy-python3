This repo serves Python 3 boilerplate for AWS Lambda with proxy integration.

## Objective
The main objective for this boilerplate is to provide a quick start for AWS Lambda Python3 development. This boilerplate starts with a minimal requirement, by only importing Python built in JSON package.

Also, please be noted that this repo is designed to accept the request from proxy integration and not suitable for a regular AWS Lambda function due to differences in 'event' variable.
